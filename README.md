# 1.-Fetch-Data-From-API-and-store-it-in-Database

In this Python script, we begin by utilizing the requests library to interact with the datausa.io API, specifically targeting population data for U.S. states. The parameters for our API call are configured to drill down into state-level details and retrieve the latest available population figures. Upon a successful API response (status code 200), we proceed to parse the JSON data. The script then establishes a connection to an SQLite database named 'datausa.db' and ensures the existence of a table named 'population_data' with appropriate columns. As we iterate through the API response data, we extract essential information such as geo_id, state name, year, and population. Geocoding, facilitated by the geopy library, transforms state names into latitude and longitude coordinates. The obtained data is subsequently inserted into the SQLite table. Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to address potential issues like JSON decoding errors or missing keys in the API response. Finally, the script commits the changes to the SQLite database and concludes with informative messages, signaling the success of the data loading process. This script serves as a comprehensive tool for retrieving, processing, and storing population data for U.S. states with geospatial details.
